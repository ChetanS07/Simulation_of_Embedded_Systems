# Simulation_of_Embedded_Systems
This project source Code is in C Language. The Topic on which this project built is REVOLUTION OF EMBEDDED SYSTEMS WITH DATA ANALYTICS.

THIS PROJECT FOCUS ON HOW WE CAN SIMULATE THE SENSORS IN EMBEDDED SYSTEMS WORKING.
THE DATA IS READ FROM THE TEXT FILE. (in my code name of file is test.txt)
THE EMBEDDED SYSTEM CONSIST OF TEMPERATURE SENSOR, GAS LEVEL SENSOR, WIND SENSOR( which tells direction of wind along with speed of the wind).
THE PROGRAM USES THE DATA STRUCTURE, DYNAMIC QUEUES( it can only store upto 20 data entries, when new entries are made one set of data is dequeued and latest one is enqueued).
YOU CAN CHECK OUT THE SOURCE CODE FOR FEARTURES AND ITS WORKING IS MENTIONED WITH COMMENTS. 

-THANK YOU.
